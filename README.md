Coding test

I am someone that when I see a problem I have to solve it.  Recently I was looking at the job page of a software company  
and they had this code test.  I didn't apply for the job because I do not want to move to New York (other cities are ok), but this challenge looked like fun and I had to do it.  I place the code here to show other protential employers what my code looks like.

Application Problem

Sort the characters in the following string:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_

by the number of times the character appears in the following text (descending):

((text not avaliable))

Now take the sorted string, and drop all the characters after (and including) the _. The remaining word is the answer.
