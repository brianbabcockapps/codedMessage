Coding test

I am someone that when I see a problem I have to solve it.  Recently I was looking at a company called Fog Creek 
and they had this code test.  I didn't apply for the job because I don't want to move to New York, but I had to do
the challenge.  I place the code here to show other protential employers what my codeing looks like.

Application Problem

Sort the characters in the following string:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_

by the number of times the character appears in the following text (descending):

((text not avaliable))

Now take the sorted string, and drop all the characters after (and including) the _. The remaining word is the answer.
